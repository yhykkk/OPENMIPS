# OpenMIPS

## Introduction
The **OpenMIPS** project is an educational, free, and open-source MIPS processor core, based on the **MIPS32** ISA. It is primarily designed to provide a hands-on learning experience, offering insight into the MIPS architecture and allowing for experimentation with various designs and implementations.

This project originates from the book _"自己动手写CPU"_ by **SiLei Lei**, in which some mistakes were revised, and the simulation portion of the educational CPU was completed. It aims to provide a platform for learning and experimentation in CPU architecture.

## Features
- **Educational Purpose**: Tailored to help users understand the MIPS architecture.
- **MIPS32 ISA**: Implements 98 instructions, including:
  - Arithmetic Instructions
  - Logical Instructions
  - Branch and Jump Instructions
  - Load and Store Instructions
  - Flush Instructions
- **RTL and Simulation**: Written in **Verilog**, providing a robust and flexible foundation for simulation.
- **Peripherals Support**: With the addition of the **Wishbone interface**, the project can now support further expansion with additional peripherals.

## Latest Enhancements
- **Wishbone Interface**: This recent addition enables the integration of more peripherals, making the OpenMIPS core even more flexible and suitable for a wide range of educational applications.

## Use Cases
- Ideal for anyone interested in learning about **MIPS architecture** and experimenting with **CPU design**.
- Suitable for educational settings, where students and developers can gain hands-on experience with processor design and simulation.

## Conclusion
OpenMIPS serves as a versatile, educational tool for anyone interested in exploring MIPS processors and understanding CPU design principles. Its open-source nature encourages experimentation, modification, and learning.
